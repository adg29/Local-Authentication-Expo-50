# Biometric Authentication for iOS with Expo SDK

## Welcome! üëã

This repository provides a comprehensive example of implementing biometric authentication for iOS using Expo SDK 50. This project is based on the original work by [üëâüèº betomoedano](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh247h68vszOMA_OWpGEa5g).

## Changelog

Upgrade core libraries and add Babel presets

Major dependencies, including Expo, React, and React Native, have been updated to their latest versions to ensure compatibility with recent features and optimizations. Additionally, new Babel presets and plugins for class properties, object spread, and environment setup have been introduced to enhance the project's build system and support modern JavaScript syntax and features. These updates may require thorough testing to ensure that the application remains stable and performs as expected.


## Get Started

Follow these steps to integrate biometric authentication into your Expo project:

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local machine and run `yarn install`.

2. **Setup**: Ensure you have iOS simulator installed.

3. **Running Example**: Run `yarn start` which starts expo and allows you to select a device from the simulator list.
